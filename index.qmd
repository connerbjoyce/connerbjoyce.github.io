::: {#hero-heading}

<div class="h1">Welcome!</div>

I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at Rice University with a focus in International Relations. My research investigates the impact of digital technology on international security. I study how technology can facilitate the emergence of security threats from non-state actors and how state actors can cooperate to mitigate these threats. I leverage original data collection, large-n observational analysis, large language models, machine learning (deep transfer learning), and experimental designs to conduct this research.

I hold a Master's degree in Public Affairs from the University of Texas LBJ School of Public Affairs and a BA in Political Science from Southwestern University.

Beginning in Fall 2026, I will join the School of Politics, Economics and Global Affairs at IE University as an Assistant Professor of Political Science. My research investigates the impact of digital technology on international security. I study how technology can facilitate the emergence of security threats from non-state actors and how state actors can cooperate to mitigate these threats. I leverage original data collection, large-n observational analysis, large language models, machine learning (deep transfer learning), and experimental designs to conduct this research.\nI hold a Master’s degree in Public Affairs from the University of Texas LBJ School of Public Affairs and a BA in Political Science from Southwestern University."

My research investigates the impact of digital technology on international security. I study how technology can facilitate the emergence of security threats from non-state actors and how state actors can cooperate to mitigate these threats. I leverage original data collection, large-n observational analysis, large language models, machine learning (deep transfer learning), and experimental designs to conduct this research.\nI hold a Master’s degree in Public Affairs from the University of Texas LBJ School of Public Affairs and a BA in Political Science from Southwestern University."
